// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers

(
Show prompt for first number
read num1
Show prompt for second number
read num2
sum = num1 + num2
Show sum
)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

(
Show prompt for number
read number

if number % 2 = 0 then
show number is even
else 
show the number is odd  
)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(
min
max
total

i = 1
While i < 6 
show enter number "i"
read number

total = total + number
if number < min then
min = number
if number > max then
max = number
end loop

average = total/5

show The average is average
show The smallest number is min
show The Largest number is max
)
